1.  File system: fs
    -This node object is used to interact with files via node. With the file system API you can manipulate, create, read from,
    and write to files. This API is very useful for data related node tasks and file manipulation node tasks.
2. URL 
    -This node module is used to format urls and interact with them. When working with urls, it is challenging to correctly format and parse them. 
    This object makes it much easier to do so. In my example I created a fake URL using the module and then found the host name and path name of it
    using this object.
3.path
    -The path module is another object that is great for working with files in node. It can be used to handle file paths and tranform them.
    This can also be used to extract specific parts of a file path. Using the path module in combination with the file system module can allow
    the user to easily access, direct to, write to, and read specific files in a directory.
4. HTTP:
    -The http module is used to create http servers and make http requests. It is used to make website and web applications. It can be used to handle different
    http methods like Get, Post, etc.
5. OS:
    -The os object can giev useful information about the user's operating system. Some things like the memory used and the memory free. This can be useful to make
    more interactive applications. For example if a user is using an older operating system then the application could be less intensive based on that information.
